In a typical introductory programming module, such as CS1010 and its variants at NUS, students tend to write small programs (in the order of tens or hundreds of lines of code) to solve a programming homework problem, work alone on their code, and move on to solve the next problem once the homework is done.</p> <p>The first aim of CS2030/S is to change the students' mindset and to make them learn to write software that will continue to evolve as software requirements change and to write software that will be read and modified by other programmers (including their future selves).</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.\"</p> <p>John Woods.</p> <p>The second aim of CS2030/S is to level up the complexity of programs that the students write, from the order of hundreds of lines to thousands of lines.  CS2030/S bridges the students between writing toy programs to solve specific problems in CS1010 and writing larger real-world software in their later modules, such as CS2103 Software Engineering.</p> <p>A programming language is the medium in which programmers can express their intention and construct software, and thus is critical to supporting the aims above.  With the appropriate features and tools, one can tame the complexity of software, make the code written friendlier to other programmers, and easier to evolve.  The third aim of CS2030/S is thus to expand the students' minds on different ways one can construct software and the principles behind some of the programming language constructs.  In particular, CS2030/S focuses on objects, types, and functions, as three key constructs for building programmer-friendly software.  It covers both object-oriented and functional paradigms as two different approaches to constructing software, with a strong emphasis on type safety.</p> <p>The final aim of CS2030/S is to introduce students to programming language concepts and to bridge them from introductory programming to advanced modules such as programming language design and implementation.  Part of CS2030/S introduces students to the design decisions behind some of the constraints and the workings behind the programming language compilation and execution, giving them a glimpse inside the programming system that so far has been mostly treated as a black box in introductory modules.</p> <p>Priority</p> <p>When writing programs to solve problems, the general priority should be the following:</p> <ol> <li>Correctness: Can your program run and solve the problem correctly.</li> <li>Efficiency: Can your program solve the problem in an efficient way.</li> <li>Maintainability: Can your program be maintained and improved upon by multiple people.</li> </ol> <p>The priority in CS1010 is correctness.  CS2040/S teaches you about how to increase efficiency while CS2030/S focuses more on maintainability.  However, you should never sacrifice on correctness.</p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#the-choice-of-java","title":"The Choice of Java","text":"<p>We decided to use one programming language throughout the module.  This decision means that we need to pick a language that is strongly typed with static typing and supports both object-oriented and functional programming.  Considering multiple factors, we decided to choose Java for CS2030/S, for its popularity, syntax familiarity, and smoother transitions to later modules in the NUS computing curriculum.</p> <p>While Java is not the most elegant programming language when expressing programs in a functional style, we hope that students can still learn the principles of functional programming and apply them in other programming languages.  This choice is a trade-off between having to switch to a different language in the middle of a module.  </p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#what-this-module-is-not-about","title":"What This Module is not About","text":"<p>This is not a module on Java programming.

In fact, we will avoid and even ban students from using certain Java features (such as <code>var</code>) for pedagogical purposes.</p> <p>This is not a module on software engineering either.  Software engineering is a broad discipline on its own and deserves another module.  Rather, this module is about the programming principles and constructs on top of which programmers can design better software.  To motivate the importance of these principles and constructs and see how they can be used, we will inevitably cover some of the software engineering design principles, such as Liskov Substitution Principle (the L in SOLID), Tell-Don't-Ask, Composition over Inheritance, etc.  But we will not comprehensively cover object-oriented design or software design in general (e.g., we will not cover S, O, I, and D in SOLID).</p> <p>Finally, CS2030/S is not a module that focuses on computational efficiency.  We have CS2040/S for that.  In CS2030/S, although reducing computational cost still plays a role, this is not the only cost that matters.  CS2030/S is also concerned with the human cost of debugging or maintaining software.  In striving for simpler software that is easier to maintain and extend, we may have to sacrifice computational efficiency.</p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#taming-complexity-in-software-development","title":"Taming Complexity in Software Development","text":"<p>An underlying theme of CS2030/S is taming complexity in software development.  There are objective metrics with which one can measure the complexity of software, but here, we will loosely define complexity as anything that increases the likelihood of bugs in a program.</p> <p>Let's start by considering a simplified view of what a software program is.  One can view a software program as a collection of data variables and instructions on how to modify these variables.  A program is generally written to meet a given requirement: given one or more input variables, the program should perform the computation to produce the output variables, in a way that meets the requirement.  Often, the program stores information in the intermediate variables while performing the computation.</p> <p>As a student who has gone through an introductory programming module such as CS1010 and its variants, you should be familiar with the view above, and you should have some experience writing a program to solve a given computational problem.  The program you have written for these introductory modules are small \"toy\" programs mostly -- they consist of only a few hundred lines and tens of variables, at most.</p> <p>Software development in the real world, however, is far more complex than what you have experienced.  A software program rarely solves a well-defined computational problem only.  It often requires multiple components, such as user interface, data storage, and business rules, intricately interacting with each other to attain a set of functionalities.  </p> <p>As the requirement of the software becomes more complex, the number of variables that need to be kept track of increases; the logic of the computation the programmer needs to maintain the variables becomes more complicated.  Further, it is often that the variables are interdependent.  For instance, updating a variable might require updating another; how a variable should be updated might depend on another variable.  As the number of variables increases, so is the number of relationships between the variables that the programmer has to keep track of.  Failure to correctly maintain the variables and the relationship between them most likely will lead to bugs.</p> <p>Further, real-world software rarely remains static.  This property is again different from what you have experienced in your introductory programming module, where once the instructors release a programming assignment, they rarely go back and change the requirement.  In the real world, software evolves -- new features are added, business rules change, and better algorithms are deployed.  The code needs to be updated accordingly -- adding new variables and new computation; changing how variables are updated or are dependent on each other.  Updating the code of an already-complex software program to keep up with the requirement, if not managed properly, can lead to bugs.</p> <p>Real-world software is often the product of teamwork from multiple programmers, where the software development process is unlike what you have experienced in your introductory programming module, where you solve your homework individually.  When multiple programmers work together, the interdependency between the states needs to be communicated and handled properly and consistently across the programmers.  One programmer's modification to the code should not introduce bugs into another programmer's code.  </p> <p>Since software evolves, the notion of \"multiple programmers\" actually applies even to software developed by a single lone programmer across time.  Changing one's code should not introduce new bugs to other parts of the code that is written some time ago.  </p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#strategies-to-tame-complexity","title":"Strategies to Tame Complexity","text":""},{"location":"00-overview.html#good-software-development-practices","title":"Good Software Development Practices","text":"<p>If you are taught properly in your introductory programming modules, you should already be familiar with good programming practices that help to tame the complexity and reduce the chances of bugs.

Let's separate the role of a programmer into two, in the context of writing functions: the implementer, who implements the function, and the client, who calls the function.  The implementer should compartmentalize the internal variables and the implementation of the function, hiding them behind the abstraction barrier.  The parameters and the return values are the only communication gateways across the barrier.  </p> <p>The abstraction barrier is something that we will refer to repeatedly in CS2030/S as well.  We will see how we maintain this barrier not only in the context of functions, but also variables and computations on these variables together, by encapsulating them as objects, and hiding details from the client through access modifiers.

It, however, also reduces flexibility as the software evolves.  If the client wishes to modify the computation protected by the abstraction barrier, it will need the help of the implementer.  In CS2030/S, we will see two ways we can modify the computation behind the abstraction barrier, without changing the code behind the barrier.  </p> <p>First, we will introduce the concept of inheritance and polymorphism, the other two core principles of object-oriented programming.  These object-oriented mechanisms allow programmers to easily extend or modify the behavior of existing code.  </p> <p>Second, we will introduce closure, an abstraction to computation and its environment, that we can pass into the functions behind the abstraction barrier to perform a computation.  The second idea, if carried to the extreme in terms of flexibility, leads to the concept of monad in the functional programming paradigm.  A monad is a computational structure that allows objects to be composed and manipulated in a succinct and powerful way.</p>"},{"location":"00-overview.html#types","title":"Types","text":"<p>Allowing a programmer to change the behavior of the existing code without changing the code could lead to more bugs, if not managed properly.  To prevent this, both the programming language system and the programmers, have to adhere to certain rules when extending or modifying the behavior of the existing code.  Java and many other typed languages have type systems -- a set of rules that governs how variables, expressions, and functions interact with each other.  You will learn about subtyping and the Liskov Substitution Principle, two notions that are important to constraining how inheritance and polymorphism should be used to avoid bugs.</p> <p>A type system is also an important tool to reduce the complexity of software development.  Constraining the interactions among the variables, expressions, and functions, it reduces the possible interdependence between these programming constructs.  Furthermore, any attempt by programmers to break the constraint can be caught automatically by the compiler.  By utilizing the type system properly, we can detect potential bugs before they manifest themselves.</p> <p>A reason CS2030/S chooses to use Java is due to its type system.  CS2030/S will introduce the concept of types, subtypes, compile-time vs. run-time types, variants of types, parameterized types, and type inferences, in the context of Java.  We will see how we can define our own types (using classes and interfaces) and define relationships between them.

In order to update an object, we need to create a new one.  With immutability and pure functions, we can guarantee that the same function invoked on the same objects will always return the same value.

The machine code is then saved into an executable file, which can be executed later.  <code>clang</code>, a C/C++ compiler, is an example.  The second approach uses an interpreter -- software that reads in the program one statement at a time interprets what the statement means, and executes its directly.

V8, for instance, is an open-source engine that executes Javascript, and it contains both an interpreter that first interprets a Javascript into bytecode (an intermediate, low-level representation).

The same variable can hold values of different unrelated types, and checking if the right type is used is done during the execution of the program.  Note that, the type is associated with the values, and the type of the variable changes depending on the value it holds.  For example, we can do the following:</p> JavascriptPython <pre><code>let i = 4;   // i is an integer\ni = \"5\";     // ok, i is now a string\n</code></pre> <pre><code>i = 4        // i is an integer\ni = \"5\"      // ok, i is now a string\n</code></pre> <p>Java, on the other hand, is a statically typed language.  We need to declare every variable we use in the program and specify its type.  A variable can only hold values of the same type as the type of the variable, so we can't assign, for instance, a string to a variable of type <code>int</code>.  Once a variable is declared with a particular, the type of the variable cannot be changed.  In other words, the variable can only hold values of that declared type.</p> <pre><code>int i;   // declare a variable of type int\ni = 4;   // ok because 4 is of type int\ni = \"5\"; // error, cannot assign a string to an `int`\n</code></pre> <p>The type that a variable is assigned with when we declare the variable is also known as the compile-time type.  During the compilation, this is the only type that the compiler is aware of.  The compiler will check if the compile-time type matches when it parses the variables, expressions, values, and function calls, and throw an error if there is a type mismatch.  This type-checking step helps to catch errors in the code early.</p> <p>Types on Variable</p> <p>An important distinction between dynamic and static type is where is the type gets attached to.  In static typing, the type is attached to the variable such that the variable can only store values of that particular type (or its subtype as you will see later).  In fact, in Java, the type that is attached to a variable is the declared type (i,e., the type written in the variable declaration also commonly known as compile-time type).</p> <p>On the other hand, in dynamically typed language, the type is attached to the value.

More specifically, <code>long</code> is 64-bit and <code>float</code> is only 32-bit.

You can immediately see that the subtype has fewer number of bits than the supertype.  Therefore, the supertype can have more possible values.

This abstraction allows programmers to group a set of instructions and give it a name.  The named set of instructions may take one or more variables as input parameters, and return zero or one values.</p> <p>Like all other abstractions, defining functions allow us to think at a higher conceptual level.  By composing functions at increasingly higher level of abstractions, we can build programs with increasing level of complexity.</p> <p>Functions help us deal with complexity in a few ways as you will see later.  For now, to understand the examples, we will first describe a basic element of a function.  Note that this cannot be compiled but need to be run on Jshell.  Once we have introduced the concept of a class, our code can be compiled.</p> <p>Syntax</p> <p>The basic syntax of a function is as follows:</p> <pre><code>return_type function_name(param_type1 param1, param_type2 param2) {\n    : // function body\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To create a function, we have to specify the return type.  If there is no return type, then we need to use the type called <code>void</code><sup>1</sup>.  This is then followed by the function name.  We may have zero or more parameters for a function.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Functions allow programmers to compartmentalize computation and its effects.  We can isolate the complexity to within its body: the intermediate variables exists only as local variables that has no effect outside of the function.  A function only interacts with the rest of the code through its parameters and return value, and so, reduces the dependencies between variables to these well-defined interactions.  Such compartmentalization reduces the complexity of code.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>int factorial(int n) {\n  if (n == 0) {\n    return 1;\n  } else {\n    return n * factorial(n - 1);\n  }\n}\ndouble e(int n) { // approximate e^n using Taylor series\n  double x = 1;\n  double res = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n    res = res + (x/factorial(i));\n    x = x * n;\n  }\n  return res;\n}\n// The n in factorial is different from the n in e.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Functions allow programmers to hide how a task is performed.  The caller of the function only needs to worry about what the function does.  By hiding the details of how, we gain two weapons against code complexity.  First, we reduce the amount of information that we need to communicate among programmers.  A fellow programmer only needs to read the documentation to understand what the parameters are for, what the return values are.  There is no need for a fellow programmer to know about the intermediate variables or the internal computation used to implement the functions.  Second, as the design and requirement evolve, the implementation of a function may change.  But, as long as the parameters and the return value of a function remains the same, the caller of the function does not have to update the code accordingly.  Reducing the need to change as the software evolves reduces the chances of introducing bugs accordingly.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>double sinc(double x) {\n  return Math.sin(x)/x;\n}\n// Do you need to know how to implement sin(x)?\n// No!  You can simply use it!\n// What you need to know is whether x supposed to be in degree or radian.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Functions allows us to reduce repetition in our code through code reuse.  If we have the same computation that we need to perform repeatedly on different values, we can construct these computations as functions, replacing the values with parameters, and pass in the values as arguments to the function.  This approach reduces the amount of boiler-plate code and has two major benefits in reducing code complexity and bugs.  First, it makes the code more succinct, and therefore easier to read and understand.  Second, it reduces the number of places in our code that we need to modify as the software evolves, and therefore, decreases the chance of introducing new bugs.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {\n    : // implementation omitted\n}\nboolean isEquilateral(double x1, double y1,\n    double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3) {\n  return distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) == distance(x2, y2, x3, y3)\n      &amp;&amp; distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) == distance(x1, y1, x3, y3);\n}\n// Define distance once, use it 4 times!\n// If we made mistake in distance, we just have to correct in one place\n//   instead of 4 different places if we did not use function.\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>Returning More Than One Return Value?</p> <p>To return more than one values, we need to use a data type that can store multiple values.

Commonly used examples are mathematical objects such as complex numbers, 2D data points, multi-dimensional vectors, circles, etc, or everyday objects such as a person, a product, etc.</p> <p>Defining composite data type allows programmers to abstract away and be separated from the concern of how a complex data type is represented.</p> <p>For instance, a circle on a 2D plane can be represented by the center (i.e., <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) and its radius <code>r</code>, or it can be represented by the top left corner (i.e., <code>x</code>,<code>y</code>) and the width <code>w</code> of the bounding square.</p> <p>In C, we build a composite data type with <code>struct</code>.

The implementation will be different if we have a different representation of <code>circle</code> (e.g., <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> may represent the center of the circle or the top left corner of the bounding square).  But once the set of functions that operates on and manipulates circles is available, we can use the circle type without worrying about the internal representation.  Of course this assumes that we will only use the functions specifically written to work on circle type.</p> <p>Additionally, the example on <code>circle_overlap</code> highlights another advantage of having composite data type.

One can view a running object-oriented (or OO) program as something that instantiates objects of different classes and orchestrates their interactions with each other by calling each others' methods.</p> <p>One could argue that an object-oriented way of writing programs is much more natural, as it mirrors our world more closely.  If we look around us, we see objects all around us, and each object has certain properties, exhibits certain behavior, and they allow certain actions.  We interact with the objects through their interfaces, and we rarely need to know the internals of the objects we used every day (unless we try to repair them)<sup>3</sup>.  </p> <p>To model a problem in an object-oriented manner, we typically model the nouns as classes and objects, the properties or relationships among the classes as fields, and the verbs or actions of the corresponding objects as methods.</p> <p>Take, for example, the following partial problem description about online airline reservation system.</p> <p>Users need to be able to make bookings from an origin to a destination airport which may comprise multiple connecting flights.

However, since not much information is known about <code>Airport</code> and assuming the only identifiable information about airport is the airport code, then maybe we do not need to create an <code>Airport</code> class.  Instead, we use a <code>String</code>.</p> <p>However, for <code>User</code> and <code>Booking</code>, we clearly need to encapsulate the information into a class.  In the case of booking, it is simply because there are 3 different properties that need to be combined.  In the case of user, we have an associated verb that needs to be modelled as method.</p> <p>When to Stop?</p> <p>In the discussion above, we put forward the possibility that <code>Airport</code> need not be a class.  So the question is, when should we stop modelling a noun as a class?  We may be too eager to model everything as a class, including the date to be stored as booking date.  There is also the opposite problem of too lazy to model.  For instance, we may lazily group user and booking together to form a class with 4 fields.</p> <p>There is no clear answer to this but as a general guide, you may want to ask the following questions.</p> <ul> <li>Is there multiple properties to be stored?<ul> <li>If so, then creating a class is good.</li> <li>In the case of airport, if there is only a single data, then we need not make a class.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is there an action associated with the entity?<ul> <li>If so, then creating a class is good.</li> <li>In the case of user, although it only has a single property, it has an association action.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is there a real world counterpart?<ul> <li>If so, model it based on the real world.</li> <li>In the case of user and booking, we have real world counterpart so we model them as separate classes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is there potential changes to the entity?<ul> <li>If so, then creating a class is good.</li> <li>For instance, if in the future we plan to store more information about an airport (e.g., the country it is located, etc), then having it as a class will minimize potential changes to other parts of the code (e.g., if we used <code>String</code> before, we now have to change all these <code>String</code> into <code>Airport</code>).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The guide above are not exhaustive.

For instance:</p> <pre><code>// Circle v0.4\nclass Circle {\n  private double x;\n  private double y;\n  private double r;\n\n  public Circle(double x, double y, double r) {\n    this.x = x;\n    this.y = y;\n    this.r = r;\n  }\n\n  public double getX() {\n    return this.x;\n  }\n\n  public void setX(double x) {\n    this.x = x;\n  }\n\n  public double getY() {\n    return this.y;\n  }\n\n  public void setY(double y) {\n    this.y = y;\n  }\n\n  public double getR() {\n    return this.r;\n  }\n\n  public void setR(double r) {\n    this.r = r;\n  }\n\n  public double getArea() {\n    return 3.141592653589793 * this.r * this.r;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the code above, we can categorise the accessor and mutator of each field as follows.</p> Fields Accessors Mutators <code>x</code> <code>getX</code> <code>setX</code> <code>y</code> <code>getY</code> <code>setY</code> <code>r</code> <code>getR</code> <code>setR</code> <p>Do note that the name <code>getProp</code> or <code>setProp</code> for a field <code>prop</code> is optional.  But it is a good practice.  For instance, we may actually name the accessor for <code>r</code> as <code>getRadius</code> and the mutator as <code>setRadius</code> shown below.</p> <pre><code>  public double getRadius() {       // originally getR\n    return this.r;\n  }\n\n  public void setRadius(double r) { // originally setR\n    this.r = r;\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>Both Accessor and Mutator</p> <p>As we have said above, having both accessor and mutator for a private field is controversial.  But it is still better than setting the field itself public.  By having accessor and mutator, we are still adding some layer of abstraction because we can change the name of the field without affecting the client.</p> <p>Another advantage is that we may be able to perform some checks on the mutator and prevents certain invalid values from ever being assigned to the field.  Consider the method <code>setR</code> in our circle v0.4 above.  A slightly better approach is to implement it with a check to prevent setting the radius zero or negative.</p> <pre><code>public void setR(double r) {\n  if (r &gt; 0) {\n    this.r = r;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Still, you should first check if you really need an accessor or a mutator for all fields.</p>"},{"location":"06-tell-dont-ask.html#the-tell-dont-ask-principle","title":"The \"Tell Don't Ask\" Principle","text":"<p>The mutators and accessors above are pretty pointless.  If we need to know the internal and do something with it, then we are breaking the abstraction barrier.  However, this is still slightly better than accessing the field directly.  Using accessors and mutators at least allow the implementer to change the name of the fields.  Unfortunately, the implementer cannot change the name of the accessors or mutators.</p> <p>Possible Change #1</p> <pre><code>class Circle {\n  private double x;\n  private double y;\n  private double radius;\n\n  public Circle(double x, double y, double r) {\n    this.x = x;\n    this.y = y;\n    this.radius = r;\n  }\n\n  // no change to getX, setX, getY, and setY\n\n  public double getR() {\n    return this.radius;\n  }\n\n  public void setR(double r) {\n    this.radius = r;\n  }\n\n  public double getArea() {\n    return 3.141592653589793 * this.r * this.r;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>So in a way, the changes are more localized.  Here, the localization is only within the class <code>Circle</code>.  The client of <code>Circle</code> need not change their code.  However, this is still not the best approach.  The better approach is to implement a method within the class that does whatever we want the class to do.</p> <p>For instance, suppose that we want to check if a given point (x,y) falls within the circle, one approach would be:</p> <pre><code>double cX = c.getX();\ndouble cY = c.getY();\ndouble r = c.getR();\nboolean isInCircle = ((x - cX) * (x - cX) + (y - cY) * (y - cY)) &lt;= r * r;\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>c</code> is a <code>Circle</code> object.</p> <p>A better approach would be to add a new <code>boolean</code> method in the <code>Circle</code> class, and call it instead:</p> <pre><code>boolean isInCircle = c.contains(x, y);\n</code></pre> <p>This better approach involves writing a few more lines of code to implement the method, but it keeps the encapsulation intact.  If one fine day, the implementer of <code>Circle</code> decided to change the representation of the circle and remove the direct accessors to the fields, then only the implementer needs to change the implementation of <code>contains</code>.  The client does not have to change anything.</p> <p>Possible Change #2</p> <pre><code>class Circle {\n  private double t; // store the top-left corner of\n  private double l; // the bounding square instead\n  private double r;\n\n  public Circle(double x, double y, double r) {\n    this.t = y + r; // compute the top bound\n    this.l = x - r; // compute the left bound\n    this.r = r;\n  }\n\n  // no more accessors/mutators\n\n  public double getArea() {\n    return 3.141592653589793 * this.r * this.r;\n  }\n\n  public boolean contains(double x, double y) {\n      : // implementation omitted but changed!\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The principle around which we can think about this is the \"Tell, Don't Ask\" principle.  The client should tell a <code>Circle</code> object what to do (compute the circumference), instead of asking \"what is your radius?\" to get the value of a field then perform the computation on the object's behalf.</p> <p>Note that in both possible changes above, the client are unaffected.  Further note that in the second possible change -- assuming the client does not use any accessors or mutators -- the code written by the client has more resistance to changes.  We not only change the name of the field but also the method implementation by redefining what it means to be contained.  The client may not even realized that internally, the implementation of <code>Circle</code> has been modified!</p> <p>Tips and Tricks</p> <p>The first tips is related to information hiding.  Although there are cases where we really have to make certain fields <code>public</code>, we would like to -- as much as possible -- first set all the fields as <code>private</code>.  Afterwards, we will need to think about the methods that are necessary for the class.  This is where the next tips will be useful.</p> <p>While there are situations where we can't avoid using accessor or modifier in a class, for beginner OO programmers like yourself, it is better to not define classes with any accessor and modifier to the private fields, and forces yourselves to think in the OO way -- to tell an object what task to perform as a client, and then implement this task within the class as a method as the implementer.</p> <p>One way to think about this is to try to think about the responsibility of the class.  Recap that the class names are typically noun.  So think about the actual object and imagine what is their responsibility.</p> <p>Take for instance a class called <code>Ball</code> and a class called <code>Player</code> (i.e., soccer player).  We can imagine that the player can kick a ball.  This is captured by the method <code>void kick(Ball b, double speed)</code> in the class <code>Player</code>.  However, it is the responsibility of the <code>Ball</code> to keep track of its own position.  This might be done by the method <code>void move(double speed)</code>.</p> <p>More closely related to the circle example, we may look at some alternative choices.  Say, for instance, we want to compute the square of the distance from the center point of the circle to any other (x, y) coordinates.  We may implement the following method</p> <pre><code>public double distanceSquared(double x, double y) {\n  double dx = this.x - x;\n  double dy = this.y - y;\n  return dx * dx + dy * dy;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Given this method, we may not even need to provide the method <code>contains</code>.  Instead, we may choose to provide both <code>distanceSquared</code> and <code>getRadius</code>.  The latter is needed because we can check if a point (x, y) is contained within a circle if the square of the distance to the center point is less than or equal to the square of the radius.</p> <p>So which design to choose?  Typically we want to minimize the number of accessors and mutators that we have.  So the design using <code>contains</code> is preferred.  If you cannot come up with such design then having both <code>distanceSquared</code> and <code>getRadius</code> is still preferable to having accessors for all three fields.</p>"},{"location":"06-tell-dont-ask.html#further-reading","title":"Further Reading","text":"<ul> <li>Tell Don't Ask by Martin Fowler</li> <li>Why getters and setters are evil, by Allen Holub, JavaWorld</li> <li>Getters and setters are evil.

Hardcoding such a magic number is a no-no in terms of coding style.  This constant appears in at least two places.  If we hardcode such a number and want to change its precision later, we would need to track down and change every occurrence.  Every time we need to use \\(\\pi\\), we have to remember or look up what is the precision that we use.  Not only does this practice introduce more work, it is also likely to introduce bugs.  </p> <p>In C, we define \\(\\pi\\) as a macro constant <code>M_PI</code>.  But how should we do this in Java?  This is where the ideal that a program consists of only objects with internal states that communicate with each other can feel a bit constraining.  The constant \\(\\pi\\) is universal, and does not really belong to any instance of circle (i.e., the value of \\(\\pi\\) is the same for every circle!).</p> <p>Another example is the method <code>sqrt()</code> that computes the square root of a given number.  <code>sqrt</code> is a general function that is not associated with any object as well.</p> <p>A solution to this is to associate these global values and functions with a class instead of with an object.  For instance. Java predefines a <code>java.lang.Math</code> class<sup>1</sup> that is populated with constants <code>PI</code> and <code>E</code> (i.e., Euler's number \\(e\\)), along with a long list of mathematical functions.  To associate a method or a field with a class in Java, we declare them with the <code>static</code> keyword.  We can additionally add a keyword <code>final</code> to indicate that the value of the field will not change and <code>public</code> to indicate that the field is accessible from outside the class.  In short, the combination of <code>public static final</code> modifiers is used for constant values in Java.</p> <pre><code>class Math {\n    :\n  public static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;\n    :\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We call these <code>static</code> fields that are associated with a class as class fields, and fields that are associated with an object as instance fields.  Note that, a <code>static</code> class field needs not be <code>final</code> and it needs not be <code>public</code>.  Class fields are useful for storing pre-computed values or configuration parameters associated with a class rather than individual objects.</p> <p>Because it is associated with the class rather than instance, we can think about <code>static</code> fields as having exactly one instance during the entire execution of the program.  So there is only exactly one instance of <code>PI</code> above regardless of how many instances of <code>Math</code> we have created.

For instance, a circle has a point as the center.</p> <p>Cylinder</p> <p>Now let's build up another layer of abstraction and construct a 3D object -- a cylinder.  A cylinder has a circle as its base and has a height value.  Using composition, we can construct a <code>Cylinder</code> class:</p> <pre><code>class Cylinder {\n  private Circle base;\n  private double height;\n\n  public Cylinder(Circle base, double height) {\n    this.base = base;\n    this.height = height;\n  }\n    : // other methods omitted\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This process of composition can be extended further.  For instance, if we think of a tire as a cylinder, then we can construct a class called <code>Car</code> as consisting of 4 cylinders corresponding to each tire.</p> <pre><code>class Car {\n  private Cylinder tire1;\n  private Cylinder tire2;\n  private Cylinder tire3;\n  private Cylinder tire4;\n    : // other parts omitted\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This way, we can create more and more complicated models!</p>"},{"location":"09-composition.html#sharing-references-aka-aliasing","title":"Sharing References (aka Aliasing)","text":"<p>Recall that unlike primitive types, reference types may share the same reference values.  This is called aliasing.  Let's look at the subtleties of how this could affect our code and catch us by surprise.</p> <p>Consider the following, where we create two circles <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> centered at the origin (0, 0).</p> <pre><code>Point p = new Point(0, 0);\nCircle c1 = new Circle(p, 1);\nCircle c2 = new Circle(p, 4);\n</code></pre> <p>Let's say that we want to allow a Circle to move its center.  For the sake of this example, let's assume that the method <code>moveTo</code> is a mutator on the class <code>Point</code> that mutates both field <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.  Suppose we want to move <code>c1</code> and only <code>c1</code> to be centered at (1,1).  In particular, we do not want to move <code>c2</code> at all.</p> <pre><code>p.moveTo(1, 1);\n</code></pre> <p>You will find that by moving <code>p</code>, we are actually moving the center of both <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>!  This result is due to both circles <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> sharing the same point.  When we pass the center into the constructor, we are passing the reference instead of passing a cloned copy of the center.  </p> <p>This is a common source of bugs and we will see how we can reduce the possibilities of such bugs later in this module, but let's first consider the following \"fix\" (that is still not ideal).</p> <p>Let's suppose that instead of moving <code>p</code>, we add a <code>moveTo</code> method to the <code>Circle</code> instead.  In other words, assume that there is no <code>moveTo</code> method in <code>Point</code> but there is a <code>moveTo</code> method in <code>Circle</code>.</p> <pre><code>class Circle {\n  private Point c;   // the center\n  private double r;  // the length of the radius\n    :\n\n  /**\n   * move the center of this circle to the given point\n   */\n  void moveTo(Point c) {\n    this.c = c;\n  }\n\n   :\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now, to move <code>c1</code>,</p> <pre><code>Point p = new Point(0, 0);\nCircle c1 = new Circle(p, 1);\nCircle c2 = new Circle(p, 4);\nc1.moveTo(new Point(1, 1));\n</code></pre> <p>You will find that <code>c1</code> will now have a new center, but <code>c2</code>'s center remains at (0,0).  Why doesn't this solve our problem then?  There is no way we can mutate <code>p</code> because invoking <code>p.moveTo(1, 1)</code> will no longer work.  We have removed the method <code>moveTo</code> on class <code>Circle</code>.  Unfortunately, recall that we can further composed circles into other objects.  Let's say that we have two cylinders: <pre><code>Cylinder cylinder1 = new Cylinder(c1, 1);\nCylinder cylinder2 = new Cylinder(c1, 1);\n</code></pre></p> <p>that share the same base, then the same problem repeats itself!  One solution is to avoid sharing references as much as possible.  For instance,</p> <pre><code>Point p1 = new Point(0, 0);\nCircle c1 = new Circle(p1, 1);\n\nPoint p2 = new Point(0, 0);\nCircle c2 = new Circle(p2, 4);\n\np1.moveTo(1, 1);\n</code></pre> <p>Without sharing references, moving <code>p1</code> only affects <code>c1</code>, so we are safe.   </p> <p>The drawback of not sharing objects with the same content is that we will have a proliferation of objects and the computational resource usage is not optimized.  This is an example of the trade offs we mentioned in the introduction to this module: we are sacrificing the computational cost to save programmers from potential suffering!</p> <p>Another approach to address this issue is immutability.

There are a few new concepts involved here so let's go through them slowly.  Click on the tabs below to find out more.</p> <code>instanceof</code> OperatorFields AccessExplicit Type Casting <pre><code>public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n  if (obj instanceof Circle) {\n    Circle circle = (Circle) obj;\n    return (circle.c.equals(this.c) &amp;&amp; circle.r == this.r);\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>equals</code> takes in a parameter of compile-time type <code>Object</code> (Line 1).  It only makes sense if we compare (during run-time) a circle with another circle.  So, we first check if the run-time type of <code>obj</code> is a subtype of <code>Circle</code>.  This is done using the <code>instanceof</code> operator.  The operator returns <code>true</code> if <code>obj</code> has a run-time type that is a subtype of <code>Circle</code>.</p> <pre><code>public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n  if (obj instanceof Circle) {\n    Circle circle = (Circle) obj;\n    return (circle.c.equals(this.c) &amp;&amp; circle.r == this.r);\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To compare <code>this</code> circle with the given circle, we have to access the center <code>c</code> and radius <code>r</code>.  But if we access <code>obj.c</code> or <code>obj.r</code>, the compiler will complain.  As far as the compiler is concerned, <code>obj</code> has the compile-time type <code>Object</code>, and there is no such fields <code>c</code> and <code>r</code> in the class <code>Object</code>!  This is why, after assuring that the run-time type of <code>obj</code> is a subtype of <code>Circle</code>, we assign <code>obj</code> to another variable <code>circle</code> that has the compile-time type <code>Circle</code>.  We finally check if the two centers are equal (again, <code>Point::equals</code> is left as an exercise) and the two radii are equal<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>Another important point is that <code>circle.c</code> and <code>circle.r</code> are allowed even when the fields <code>c</code> and <code>r</code> are declared <code>private</code> because we are inside the class <code>Circle</code>.  So even if the fields belong to another object, as long as it is in the same class, it is allowed.</p> <pre><code>public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n  if (obj instanceof Circle) {\n    Circle circle = (Circle) obj;\n    return (circle.c.equals(this.c) &amp;&amp; circle.r == this.r);\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The statement that assigns <code>obj</code> to <code>circle</code> involves type casting.  We mentioned before that Java is strongly typed and so it is very strict about type conversion.  Here, Java allows type casting from type \\(T\\) to \\(S\\) if \\(S &lt;: T\\)<sup>3</sup>.  By allow, we meant that Java compiler will not give compilation error.</p> <p>This is called narrowing type conversion.  Unlike widening type conversion, which is always allowed and always correct, a narrowing type conversion requires explicit typecasting and validation during run-time.  If we do not ensure that <code>obj</code> has the correct run-time type, casting can lead to a run-time error (which if you recall, is bad).</p> <p>The syntax for explicit type conversion is <code>(Type) expr</code>.  Java will attempt to convert the result of the expression <code>expr</code> into the type <code>Type</code>.  While you may also add explicit type casting for widening type conversion, such explicit type casting is not necessary and can be omitted.</p> <p>All these complications would go away, however, if we define <code>Circle::equals</code> to take in a <code>Circle</code> as a parameter, like this:</p> <pre><code>class Circle {\n    :\n  /**\n   * Return true the object is the same circle (i.e., same center, same radius).\n   */\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Circle circle) {\n    return (circle.c.equals(this.c) &amp;&amp; circle.r == this.r);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This version of <code>equals</code> however, does not override <code>Object::equals(Object)</code>.  Since we hinted to the compiler that we meant this to be an overriding method, using <code>@Override</code>, the compiler will give us an error.  This is not treated as method overriding, since the signature for <code>Circle::equals(Circle)</code> is different from <code>Object::equals(Object)</code>.</p> <p>Why then is overriding important?  Why not just leave out the line <code>@Override</code> and live with the non-overriding, one-line, <code>equals</code> method above?  Keep this question in mind as this will be answered when we discuss dynamic binding.</p> <p>Why is it called Narrowing?</p> <p>Because the subclass inherits from superclass, it may seem like the subclass has \"more\" properties.  So it seems counter-intuitive why such conversion is called narrowing.  Take, for instance, <code>Circle</code> and <code>ColoredCircle</code>.  <code>ColoredCircle</code> has an additional property called <code>color</code>.  So why converting from <code>Circle</code> to <code>ColoredCircle</code> is called narrowing?</p> <p>The reason here is that a <code>ColoredCircle</code> is a <code>Circle</code> but the opposite is not true (i.e., <code>Circle</code> is not <code>ColoredCircle</code>).  Consider adding another class <code>SpinningCircle</code> such that <code>SpinningCircle</code> &lt;: <code>Circle</code>.  Then, <code>Circle</code> contains all possible <code>Circle</code> + all possible <code>ColoredCircle</code> + all possible <code>SpinningCircle</code>.  On the other hand, <code>SpinningCircle</code> only contains all possible <code>SpinningCircle</code>.</p> <p>We can see that the possible values for <code>Circle</code> is larger than the possible values for <code>SpinningCircler</code>.  So converting from <code>Circle</code> to <code>SpinningCircle</code> will indeed narrow down our possible value.</p>"},{"location":"14-polymorphism.html#the-power-of-polymorphism","title":"The Power of Polymorphism","text":"<p>Let's consider the following example.

So if the run-time type of <code>curr</code> is <code>Circle</code>, then we will invoke <code>Circle::equals(Object)</code> and if the run-time type of <code>curr</code> is <code>Point</code>, then we will invoke <code>Point::equals(Object)</code>.  This, of course, assumes that <code>Object::equals(Object)</code> is overridden in both classes.</p> <p>Now, if <code>Circle::equals</code> takes in a <code>Circle</code> as the parameter (i.e., <code>Circle::equals(Circle)</code>), the call to <code>equals</code> inside the method <code>contains</code> would not invoke <code>Circle::equals(Circle)</code>.  It would invoke <code>Object::equals(Object)</code> instead due to the matching method signature, and we can't search for <code>Circle</code> based on semantic equality.</p> <p>But why are we searching for <code>equals(Object)</code> in the first place?  Look closely at how the method is invoked: <code>curr.equals(obj)</code>.  Here, we can see that the parameter we are passing is <code>obj</code>.  The compile-time type of <code>obj</code> is <code>Object</code> as seen from the parameter declaration at Line 2.  So at compile-time, we only know that its type is <code>Object</code>.</p> <p>To have a generic <code>contains</code> method without polymorphism and overriding, we will have to do something like this:</p> <pre><code>// version 0.2 (without polymorphism)\nboolean contains(Object[] array, Object obj) {\n  for (Object curr : array) {\n    if (obj instanceof Circle) {\n      if (curr.equals((Circle)obj)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n    } else if (obj instanceof Square) {\n      if (curr.equals((Square)obj)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n    } else if (obj instanceof Point) {\n      if (curr.equals((Point)obj)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n    }\n     :\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>which is not scalable since every time we add a new class, we have to come back to this method and add a new branch to the <code>if-else</code> statement!</p> <p>As this example has shown, polymorphism allows us to write succinct code that is future proof.

In this case, we choose the most specific one.</p> <p>More Specific</p> <p>Intuitively, a method \\(M\\) is more specific than method \\(N\\) if the arguments to \\(M\\) can be passed to \\(N\\) without compilation error.</p> <p>This may seem abstract so let's make it more concrete.  We will consider \\(A &lt;: B &lt;: C\\).  Consider two method signature below.</p> <ul> <li><code>foo(A)</code></li> <li><code>foo(C)</code></li> </ul> <p>Now we consider the \"arguments to the method\":</p> <ul> <li>Arguments to <code>foo(A)</code>: type <code>A</code> and the subtype of <code>A</code>.</li> <li>Arguments to <code>foo(C)</code>: type <code>A</code>, type <code>B</code>, type <code>C</code>, and the subtype of <code>A</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Note that the argument to <code>foo(A)</code> (i.e., type <code>A</code> and the subtype of <code>A</code>) can be passed to <code>foo(C)</code> without any compilation error because <code>foo(C)</code> can accept both type <code>A</code> and the subtype of <code>A</code>.</p> <p>On the other hand, the argument to <code>foo(C)</code> cannot be passed to <code>foo(A)</code>.  Take, for instance, type <code>B</code>.  It cannot be passed to <code>foo(A)</code>.</p> <p>So, <code>foo(A)</code> is more specific than <code>foo(C)</code>.</p> <p>For example, let's say a class <code>Circle</code> implements:</p> <pre><code>boolean equals(Circle c) { .. }\n\n@Override\nboolean equals(Object c) { .. }\n</code></pre> <p>Then, <code>equals(Circle)</code> is more specific than <code>equals(Object)</code>.  Every <code>Circle</code> is an <code>Object</code>, but not every <code>Object</code> is a <code>Circle</code>.  Let's try to understand this in more details using the definition of \"more specific\" above.</p> <p>First, in the phrase \"if the arguments to \\(M\\) can be passed to \\(N\\) without compilation error\", we need to find what arguments can be accepted by the methods we wish to compare.  In the case of <code>equals(Circle)</code>, it can accept <code>Circle</code> (and all its subclasses).  On the other hand, for <code>equals(Object)</code>, it can accept <code>Object</code> and also <code>Circle</code>.</p> <p>Now we simply have to test if <code>equals(Circle)</code> can accept whatever can be accepted by <code>equals(Object)</code> and vice versa.  So we test <code>equals(Circle)</code> and attempt to pass <code>Object</code> and <code>Circle</code> as argument (since <code>equals(Object)</code> can accept both <code>Object</code> and <code>Circle</code>).  It will pass on <code>Circle</code> but it will fail on <code>Object</code>.</p> <p>Similarly, we test <code>equals(Object)</code> and attempt to pass <code>Circle</code> (since <code>equals(Circle)</code> can only accept <code>Circle</code>).  There is definitely no compilation error here.  So now we have seen that if we set \\(M\\) as the method <code>equals(Circle)</code> and \\(N\\) as <code>equals(Object)</code>,</p> <p>the arguments to \\(M\\) (i.e., <code>equals(Circle)</code>, the argument is <code>Circle</code>) can be passed to \\(N\\) (i.e., <code>equals(Object)</code> can accept <code>Circle</code>) without compilation error.</p> <p>Therefore, <code>equals(Circle)</code> is more specific than <code>equals(Object)</code>.  There is a possibility that comparing only two arbitrary methods, we will find that none of the two methods is more specific!  For instance, given <code>S1</code> &lt;: <code>T</code> and <code>S2</code> &lt;: <code>T</code>, <code>foo(S1)</code> is not more specific than <code>foo(S2)</code> and <code>foo(S2)</code> is not more specific than <code>foo(S1)</code>.</p> <p>Once the method is determined, the method's descriptor (return type and signature) is stored in the generated code.</p> <p>In the example above, the method descriptor <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> will be stored in the generated binaries.  Note that it does not include information about the class that implements this method.  The class to take this method implementation from will be determined in Step 2 during run-time.</p>"},{"location":"15-dynamic-binding.html#during-run-time","title":"During Run Time","text":"<p>During execution, when a method is invoked, the method descriptor from Step 1 is first retrieved.

Thus, the method <code>Object::equals(Object)</code> is executed.</p> <p>Now, suppose that <code>Circle</code> overrides the method <code>Object::equals(Object)</code> with its own <code>Circle::equals(Object)</code> method.

We can use many ways to specify the desirable property but the most common is the use of program specification.</p> <p>Example #1: Module</p> <p>Specification</p> <p>We define a class called <code>Module</code> with a method <code>Module::marksToGrade</code>.  The desirable property of this method is that it takes in a <code>double</code> as input and returns a character (i.e., of type <code>char</code>).  The character that are returned is one of the following: <code>'A'</code>, <code>'B'</code>, <code>'C'</code>, or <code>'F'</code>.  How the method <code>Module::marksToGrade</code> is implemented is irrelevant as long as it returns one of the characters above.</p> <p>Usage</p> <pre><code>void displayGrade(Module m, double marks) {\n  char grade = m.marksToGrade(marks);\n  if (grade == 'A')) {\n    System.out.println(\"well done\");\n  } else if (grade == 'B') {\n    System.out.println(\"good\");\n  } else if (grade == 'C') {\n    System.out.println(\"ok\");\n  } else {\n    System.out.println(\"retake again\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Subclass</p> <p>Consider a subclass of <code>Module</code> called <code>CSCUModule</code>.  <code>CSCUModule</code> overrides <code>marksToGrade</code> method such that it now returns only <code>'S'</code> or <code>'U'</code>.

The object <code>m</code> has the following property: <code>m.marksToGrade</code> always returns something from the set { <code>'A'</code>, <code>'B'</code>, <code>'C'</code>, <code>'F'</code> }, that the method <code>displayGrade</code> depends on explicitly.  The subclass <code>CSCUModule</code> violated that and makes <code>m.marksToGrade</code> returns <code>'S'</code> or <code>'U'</code>, sabotaging <code>displayGrade</code> and causing it to fail.</p> <p>LSP cannot be enforced by the compiler<sup>1</sup>.

When we write a method, we may want to introduce test cases to check that our method is working correctly. These test cases are designed based on the specification of our method and not its implementation details<sup>2</sup>. That is, we test based on the expected inputs and resultant outputs.</p> <p>Example #2: Restaurant</p> <p>Specification</p> <p>We would like to model a restaurant booking system for a restaurant chain. Every restaurant in the chain opens at 12 pm and closes at 10 pm, and has a singular method <code>canMakeReservation</code> which allows us to check if the restaurant is available for reservations at a certain <code>time</code>.  The requirement given is that, the system must be able to process a reservation during its opening hours.  On the other hand, we do not care about the behavior outside of the opening hour.</p> <p>We may then arrive at the following class:</p> <pre><code>public class Restaurant {\n  public static final int OPENING_HOUR = 1200;\n  public static final int CLOSING_HOUR = 2200;\n\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    if (time &lt;= CLOSING_HOUR &amp;&amp; time &gt;= OPENING_HOUR) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Usage (i.e., Test)</p> <p>The method <code>canMakeReservation</code> returns <code>true</code> when the argument passed in to <code>time</code> is between 12 pm and 10 pm. Let's think about how we would test this method.  Two important edge cases to test is to check if the method returns true for the stated restaurant opening and closing hours.</p> <pre><code>Restaurant r = new Restaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Note that these are simple <code>jshell</code> tests, in software engineering modules (e.g., CS2103/T) you will learn better ways to design and formalise these tests.</p> <p>Subclass #1</p> <p>Consider a subclass of <code>Restaurant</code> called <code>LunchRestaurant</code> with the following implementation:</p> <pre><code>public class LunchRestaurant extends Restaurant {\n  private final int peakHourStart = 1200;\n  private final int peakHourEnd = 1400;\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    if (time &lt;= peakHourEnd &amp;&amp; time &gt;= peakHourStart) {\n      return false;\n    } else if (time &lt;= CLOSING_HOUR &amp;&amp; time &gt;= OPENING_HOUR) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>LunchRestaurant</code> does not take reservation during peak hours (i.e., 1200 to 1400).  As <code>LunchRestaurant</code> \\(&lt;:\\) <code>Restaurant</code>, we can point our variable <code>r</code> to a new instance of <code>LunchRestaurant</code> and run the test cases of the parent class, as can be seen in the code below.</p> <pre><code>Restaurant r = new LunchRestaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is false, therefore test fails\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Whilst the second test passes, the first test does not since it falls within the peak lunch hour.  Therefore <code>LunchRestaurant</code> is not substitutable for <code>Restaurant</code> and the LSP is violated.  We have changed the expectation of the method in the child class.</p> <p>Subclass #2</p> <p>Let's suppose the restaurant chain starts to roll out online reservation system for a subset of its restaurants.  These restaurants can take reservations any time.  We create a subclass <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code>, as follows:</p> <pre><code>public class DigitalReadyRestaurant extends Restaurant {\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, as <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> \\(&lt;:\\) <code>Restaurant</code>, we can point our variable <code>r</code> to a new instance of <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> and run the test cases of the parent class, as can be seen in the code below.</p> <pre><code>Restaurant r = new DigitalReadyRestaurant();\nr.canMakeReservation(1200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n  : // test for other hours between 1200 - 2200\nr.canMakeReservation(2200) == true; // Is true, therefore test passes\n</code></pre> <p>Both test cases pass.  In fact, all test cases that pass for <code>Restaurant</code> would pass for <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code>.  Therefore <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> is substitutable for <code>Restaurant</code>. Anywhere we can use an object of type <code>Restaurant</code>, we can use <code>DigitalReadyRestaurant</code> without breaking any previously written code.</p> <p>We can now rephrase our LSP in terms of testing. A subclass should not break the expectations set by the superclass. If a class <code>B</code> is substitutable for a parent class <code>A</code> then it should be able to pass all test cases of the parent class <code>A</code>. If it does not, then it is not substitutable and the LSP is violated. </p>"},{"location":"16-lsp.html#preventing-inheritance-and-method-overriding","title":"Preventing Inheritance and Method Overriding","text":"<p>Sometimes, it is useful for a developer to explicitly prevent a class to be inherited.

For instance, we abstract a circle into a point and a radius such that we can only check if another point is contained within the circle or not via <code>Circle::contains</code> method.  While a circle may also be transformed, as long as we do not have such methods, the behavior is not captured by our abstracted circle.</p> <p>When we code, we should, as much as possible, try to work with the higher-level abstraction, rather than the detailed version.

But, one cannot simply change the interface and add these abstract methods now.  The other developers will have to change their classes to add the implementation of two methods, or else their code would not compile!</p> <p>This is what happened to the Java language when they changed from version 7 to version 8.  The language needed to add a bunch of useful methods to standard interfaces provided by the Java library, but doing so would break existing code in the 1990s that rely on these interfaces.</p> <p>The solution that Java came up with is the allow an interface to provide a default implementation of methods that all implementation subclasses will inherit (unless they override).

This leads to a less elegant situation where an <code>interface</code> has some abstract methods and some non-abstract default methods.

Consider writing a method that reads in a single integer value from a file.  Here are some things that could go wrong:</p> <ul> <li>The file to read from may not exist.</li> <li>The file to read from exists, but you may not have permission to read it.</li> <li>You can open the file for reading, but it might contain non-numeric text where you expect numerical values.</li> <li>The file might contain fewer values than expected.</li> <li>The file might become unreadable as you are reading through it (e.g., someone unplugs the USB drive).</li> </ul> <p>In C, we usually have to write code like this:</p> <pre><code>fd = fopen(filename,\"r\");\nif (fd == NULL) {\n  fprintf(stderr, \"Unable to open file.\");\n  if (errno == ENFILE) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"Too many opened files.  Unable to open another\\n\");\n  } else if (errno == ENOENT) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"No such file %s\\n\", filename);\n  } else if (errno == EACCES) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"No read permission to %s\\n\", filename);\n  }\n  return -1;\n}\nscanned = fscanf(fd, \"%d\", &amp;value);\nif (scanned == 0) {\n  fprintf(stderr, \"Unable to scan for an integer\\n\");\n  fclose(fd);\n  return -2;\n}\nif (scanned == EOF) {\n  fprintf(stderr, \"No input found.\\n\");\n  fclose(fd);\n  return -3;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Out of the lines above, only TWO lines correspond to the actual task of opening and reading in a file, the others are for exception checking/handling.  The actual tasks are interspersed between exception checking code, which makes reading and understanding the logic of the code difficult.</p> <p>The examples above also have to return different values to the calling method, because the calling method may have to do something to handle the errors. Note that the POSIX API has a global variable <code>errno</code> that signifies the detailed error. First, we have to check for different <code>errno</code> values and react accordingly (we can use <code>perror</code>, but that has its limits). Second, <code>errno</code> is global, and using a global variable is a bad practice.  In fact, the code above might not work because <code>fprintf</code> in Line 3 might have changed <code>errno</code>.</p> <p>Finally, there is the issue of having to repeatedly clean up after an error -- here we <code>fclose</code> the file if there is an error reading, twice. It is easy to forget to do so if we have to do this in multiple places.  Furthermore, if we need to perform a more complex clean up, then we would end up with lots of repeated code.</p> <p>Many modern programming languages support exceptions as a programming construct.  In Java, this is done with <code>try</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>finally</code> keywords, and a hierarchy of <code>Exception</code> classes.  The <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>/<code>finally</code> keywords group statements that check/handle errors together making code easier to read. The Java equivalent to the above is:</p> <pre><code>try {\n  reader = new FileReader(filename);\n  scanner = new Scanner(reader);\n  value = scanner.nextInt();\n}\ncatch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n  System.err.println(\"Unable to open \" + filename + \" \" + e);\n}\ncatch (InputMismatchException e) {\n  System.err.println(\"Unable to scan for an integer\");\n}\ncatch (NoSuchElementException e) {\n  System.err.println(\"No input found\");\n}\nfinally {\n  if (scanner != null)\n    scanner.close();\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>if</code>-<code>else</code> vs <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code></p> <p>As much as possible, you should try checking for potential error condition using <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> as opposed to try to let it run and catch error using <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>.  You may wonder in the case of reading file, why not just check if the file exists instead of catching <code>FileNotFoundException</code>.  Something along the line of</p> <pre><code>File f = new File(\"path/to/file\");\nif (f.exists() &amp;&amp; !f.isDirectory()) {\n  // are you sure the file still exists in between?\n  f.open();\n  // do something\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You do not need to understand the detail of the code above.  What you need to know to answer this is that your computer runs a lot of other programs.  Given the current processor capabilities, these programs may actually run at the same time.  This means that in between the check that the file exists (i.e., <code>f.exists()</code>) and what you want to do with the file (i.e., in between <code>f.exists()</code> and <code>f.open()</code>), the file may actually already be removed by another program!</p> <p>Such occurrences is rare, but we still need to safeguard against it.

This may happen when you are reading file using <code>FileReader</code> class.  Your code may look like the following</p> <pre><code>FileReader file = null;\ntry {\n  file = new FileReader(\"/path/to/file\");\n  // the constructor may throw IOException\n  // reading may also throw IOException\n} catch(IOException e) {\n  // handle exception\n} finally {\n  if (file != null) {\n    file.close();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>That looks like a perfectly reasonable code except for the fact the <code>file.close()</code> may actually throw an <code>IOException</code>.  Since <code>IOException</code> is a checked exception, you must either handle the exception or pass the buck.  To handle the exception, the code requires nested <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>-<code>finally</code>.</p> <pre><code>FileReader file = null;\ntry {\n  file = new FileReader(\"/path/to/file\");\n  // the constructor may throw IOException\n  // reading may also throw IOException\n} catch(IOException e) {\n  // handle exception\n} finally {\n  if (file != null) {\n    try {\n      file.close();\n    } catch(IOException e) {\n      // not sure what to do, probably just do nothing\n    }\n    // finally is also probably not needed\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>So there you have it, a nested <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>-<code>finally</code> and something that cannot even be considered to be a bad practice.  Luckily, we do not use <code>FileReader</code> in this module.</p> <ol> <li> <p><code>Exception</code> has a superclass called <code>Throwable</code>.  You can also catch a <code>Throwable</code>.  Although the name has a suffix \"-able\", it is not an interface but an actual class.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>An even worse offence would be to <code>catch(Throwable t)</code>.

The upper-bounded wildcard has the following subtyping relations:</p> <ul> <li>If <code>S</code> &lt;: <code>T</code>, then <code>A&lt;? extends S&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>A&lt;? extends T&gt;</code> (covariance)</li> <li>For any type <code>S</code>, <code>A&lt;S&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>A&lt;? extends S&gt;</code></li> </ul> <p>To see this, consider <code>Array&lt;? extends Circle&gt;</code> and <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code>.  Now we look at the types that can be used to substitute <code>?</code> in both cases.  The types are summarized in the table below.</p> <code>Array&lt;? extends Circle&gt;</code> <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code> - <code>Shape</code> <code>Circle</code> <code>Circle</code> - <code>Square</code> <code>ColoredCircle</code> <code>ColoredCircle</code> <code>LinedCircle</code> <code>LinedCircle</code> <p>So, whatever type can be used to substitute <code>?</code> in <code>Array&lt;? extends Circle&gt;</code> can also be used to substitute <code>?</code> in <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code>.  So the following assignment would work because whatever type we substitute <code>?</code> with, <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code> can accept those.</p> <pre><code>Array&lt;? extends Circle&gt; arr1 = ..; // run-time type omitted\nArray&lt;? extends Shape&gt; arr2 = arr1;\n</code></pre> <p>The table can also be visualized using class diagram.  Blue background highlights the type that can be used to substitute <code>?</code> for <code>Array&lt;? extends Circle&gt;</code> and red background highlights the type that can be used to substitute <code>?</code> for <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code>.  If one is a subset of the other, it implies a subtyping relationship.</p> <p></p> <p>Simply using the covariance rule above, we can also infer a few things.  For instance, we can infer <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code>.  The proof is as follows</p> <ol> <li><code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Shape</code> (given)</li> <li><code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? extends Circle&gt;</code> (upper-bounded wildcard property)</li> <li><code>Array&lt;? extends Circle&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code> (using (1) and covariance of upper-bounder wildcard)</li> <li><code>Array&lt;ircle&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code> (transitivity of subtyping relationship using (2) and (3))</li> </ol> <p>So now, because <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;</code>, if we change the type of the parameter to <code>copyFrom</code> to <code>Array&lt;? extends T&gt;</code>, </p> <pre><code>  public void copyFrom(Array&lt;? extends T&gt; src) {\n    int len = Math.min(this.array.length, src.array.length);\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\n      this.set(i, src.get(i));\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>We can now call:</p> <pre><code>shapeArray.copyFrom(circleArray); // OK: Array&lt;Circle&gt; &lt;: Array&lt;? extends Shape&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>without error.</p>"},{"location":"26-wildcard.html#lower-bounded-wildcards","title":"Lower-Bounded Wildcards","text":"<p>Let's now try to allow copying of an <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code> to <code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code>.</p> <pre><code>circleArray.copyTo(shapeArray); \n</code></pre> <p>by doing the same thing:</p> <pre><code>  public void copyTo(Array&lt;? extends T&gt; dest) {\n    int len = Math.min(this.array.length, dest.array.length);\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\n        dest.set(i, this.get(i));\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>The code above would not compile.

So, the different <code>?</code> can be replaced with different type arguments.</p> <p>Let's try not to understand what the error message means first, and think about what could go wrong if the compiler allows:</p> <pre><code>        dest.set(i, this.get(i));\n</code></pre> <p>Here, we are trying to put an instance with compile-time type <code>T</code> into an array that contains elements with the compile-time type of <code>T</code> or subtype of <code>T</code>.  </p> <p>The <code>copyTo</code> method of <code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code> would allow an <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code> as an argument, and we would end up putting instance with compile-time type <code>Shape</code> into <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code>.  If all the shapes are circles, we are fine, but there might be other shapes (rectangles, squares) in <code>this</code> instance of <code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code>, and we can't fit them into <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code>!  Thus, the line </p> <pre><code>        dest.set(i, this.get(i));\n</code></pre> <p>is not type-safe and could lead to <code>ClassCastException</code> during run-time.  </p> <p>Where can we copy our shapes into?  We can only copy them safely into an <code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code>, <code>Array&lt;Object&gt;</code>, for instance.  In other words, into arrays containing <code>Shape</code> or supertype of <code>Shape</code>.  Unfortunately our running example no longer have <code>GetAreable</code>.  Otherwise, we can also safely insert into <code>Array&lt;GetAreable&gt;</code> too!</p> <p>We need a wildcard lower-bounded by <code>Shape</code>, and Java's syntax for this is <code>? super Shape</code>.  Using this new notation, we can replace the type for <code>dest</code> with:</p> <pre><code>  public void copyTo(Array&lt;? super T&gt; dest) {\n    int len = Math.min(this.array.length, dest.array.length);\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\n      dest.set(i, this.get(i));\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>The code would now type-check and compile.  We can do the entire reasoning similar to the reasoning we did for upper-bounder wildcard.  First, let's keep it specific.  We will let <code>T</code> to be <code>Circle</code>.  This means <code>Array&lt;? super T&gt;</code> should be treated as <code>Array&lt;? super Circle&gt;</code><sup>1</sup>.  So now we try to figure out what are the types that can be used to substitute <code>?</code> in <code>Array&lt;? super Circle&gt;</code>.  There are only 3 possible types:</p> <ul> <li><code>Circle</code>: because <code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Circle</code> so we get <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code>.</li> <li><code>Shape</code>: because <code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Shape</code> so we get <code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code>.</li> <li><code>Object</code>: because <code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Object</code> so we get <code>Array&lt;Object&gt;</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Again, visually, this will be the following class diagram.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, looking back at the relevant part of the code of <code>copyTo</code>, we see the following line:</p> <pre><code>        dest.set(i, this.get(i));\n</code></pre> <p>First, the method <code>set</code> has the following signature: <code>Array::set(int, T)</code>.  The type <code>T</code> depends on the type of <code>dest</code>.  Second, the method <code>get</code> has the following descriptor <code>T Array::get(int)</code>.  The type<code>T</code> depends on the type of <code>this</code>.</p> <p>Now, remember, the compile-time type of <code>dest</code> is <code>Array&lt;? super Circle&gt;</code> and the compile-time type of <code>this</code> is <code>Array&lt;Circle&gt;</code> (because we let <code>T</code> to be <code>Circle</code>).  By process of enumeration, we see that all possibilities of types that can be used to substitute <code>?</code> in the compile-time type of <code>dest</code> can safely accept <code>Circle</code>.</p> <ul> <li><code>Circle</code>: the method signature for <code>set</code> is <code>Array::set(int, Circle)</code> and the return type of <code>Array::get(int)</code> is <code>Circle</code> so this type-checked because <code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Circle</code>.</li> <li><code>Shape</code>: the method signature for <code>set</code> is <code>Array::set(int, Shape)</code> and the return type of <code>Array::get(int)</code> is <code>Circle</code> so this type-checked because <code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Shape</code>.</li> <li><code>Object</code>: the method signature for <code>set</code> is <code>Array::set(int, Object)</code> and the return type of <code>Array::get(int)</code> is <code>Circle</code> so this type-checked because <code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Object</code>.</li> </ul> <p>The lower-bounded wildcard is an example of contravariance.  We have the following subtyping relations:</p> <ul> <li>If <code>S</code> &lt;: <code>T</code>, then <code>A&lt;? super T&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>A&lt;? super S&gt;</code> (contravariance)</li> <li>For any type <code>S</code>, <code>A&lt;S&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>A&lt;? super S&gt;</code></li> </ul> <p>Without going into the lengthy explanation with the tables, we will show the class diagram showing that <code>Array&lt;? super Shape&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>Array&lt;? super Circle&gt;</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Since we did the proof for upper-bounded wildcard, let us do the same for lower-bounded wildcard.  We will show that <code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? super Circle&gt;</code>.</p> <ol> <li><code>Circle</code> &lt;: <code>Shape</code> (given)</li> <li><code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? super Shape&gt;</code> (lower-bounded wildcard property)</li> <li><code>Array&lt;? super Shape&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? super Circle&gt;</code> (using (1) and contravariance of lower-bounded wildcard)</li> <li><code>Array&lt;Shape&gt;</code> &lt;: <code>Array&lt;? super Circle&gt;</code> (transitivity of subtyping relationship using (2) and (3))</li> </ol> <p>The line of code below now compiles:</p> <pre><code>circleArray.copyTo(shapeArray); \n</code></pre> <p>Our new <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> is now</p> <pre><code>// version 0.5 (with flexible copy using wildcards)\nclass Array&lt;T&gt; {\n  private T[] array;\n\n  Array(int size) {\n  // The only way we can put an object into the array is through\n  // the method set() and we only put an object of type T inside.\n  // So it is safe to cast `Object[]` to `T[]`.\n  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    T[] a = (T[]) new Object[size];\n  this.array = a;\n  }\n\n  public void set(int index, T item) {\n    this.array[index] = item;\n  }\n\n  public T get(int index) {\n    return this.array[index];\n  }\n\n  public void copyFrom(Array&lt;? extends T&gt; src) {\n    int len = Math.min(this.array.length, src.array.length);\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\n      this.set(i, src.get(i));\n    }\n  }\n\n  public void copyTo(Array&lt;? super T&gt; dest) {\n    int len = Math.min(this.array.length, dest.array.length);\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\n      dest.set(i, this.get(i));\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Non Subtype Reasoning</p> <p>So far, we have shown the visualization for subtyping relationship.

Since we are looking through the lens of a method, the method consumes a value via its parameter.  Additionally, the method produces a value via its return value.</p> <p>Assume that we have the following six variables.  We have to exclude <code>Shape</code> because it cannot be instantiated.

We need to look at it from the point of view of the implementer.  Consider that as an implementer, you will always do the following line.</p> <pre><code>res2 = f(arg2);\n</code></pre> <p>So now, we need to know which of the following method descriptor can be used for <code>f</code>.

Recall that <code>Object</code> is the supertype of all reference types.  When we want to write a method that takes in a reference type, but we want the method to be flexible enough, we can make the method accept a parameter of type <code>Object</code>.  Similarly, <code>Array&lt;?&gt;</code> is useful when you want to write a method that takes in an array of some specific type, and you want the method to be flexible enough to take in an array of any type.  For instance, if we have:</p> <pre><code>void foo(Array&lt;?&gt; array) {\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We could call it with: <pre><code>Array&lt;Circle&gt; ac;\nArray&lt;String&gt; as;\nfoo(ac); // ok\nfoo(as); // ok\n</code></pre></p> <p>A method that takes in generic type with unbounded wildcard would be pretty restrictive, however.

Although it makes the code more verbose and cluttered -- it is a small price to pay for ensuring the type correctness of the code and reducing the likelihood of bugs as the code complexity increases.</p> <p>Java, however, allows the programmer to skip some of the type annotations and try to infer the type argument of a generic method and a generic type, through the type inference process.  The basic idea of type inference is simple: Java will looking among the matching types that would lead to successful type checks, and pick the most specific ones.</p> <p>There are deviations to the \"most specific\" ones but that is because Java will only infer based on the type that is available in the type constraints.

They can be safely encapsulated within <code>Sender</code> as inner classes, so that these classes can access the fields within the <code>Sender</code> class, simplifying their implementation.  How many times have you wished that the <code>id</code> can be accessed directly?</p> <p>With this design, since we cannot access the constructor of <code>SingleSender</code> and <code>MultiSender</code> directly, we have to create a (possibly overloaded) static method in <code>Sender</code> that creates either <code>SingleSender</code> or <code>MultiSender</code> depending on the input.  Something along the following:</p> <pre><code>public static Sender make(int actionTime, String message) {\n  return new SingleSender(actionTime, message);\n}\npublic static Sender make(int actionTime, String[] messages) {\n  return new MultiSender(actionTime, messages);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A nested class can be either static or non-static.  Just like static fields and static methods, a static nested class is associated with the containing class, NOT an instance.  So, it can only access static fields and static methods of the containing class.  A non-static nested class, on the other hand, can access all fields and methods of the containing class.

Java has a piece of syntax called qualified <code>this</code> to resolve this.  A qualified <code>this</code> reference is prefixed with the enclosing class name, to differentiate between the <code>this</code> of the inner class and the <code>this</code> of the enclosing class.  In the example above, we can access <code>x</code> from <code>A</code> through the <code>A.this</code> reference.</p> <pre><code>class A {\n private int x;\n\n class B {\n   void foo() {\n     A.this.x = 1; // ok\n   }\n }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Fully Qualified Name</p> <p>Recap the fully qualified name.

We write \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y\\).  Every input in the domain must map to exactly one output but multiple inputs can map to the same output.  Not all values in the codomain need to be mapped.</p> <p>Let us illustrate this.  We can represent the <code>abs</code> function as a mapping from <code>int</code> to <code>int</code>.  So the domain is <code>int</code> and the codomain is <code>int</code>.  If the value is negative, we map the value to its positive value.  On the other hand, if the value is already positive, we map the value to itself.  This shows that not all values in the codomain are mapped.  However, all values in the domain must be mapped and, in fact, they are mapped to exactly one value in the codomain.</p> <p></p> <p>We know how to deal with mathematical functions very well.  There are certain rules that we follow when we reason about functions.  For instance, suppose we have an unknown \\(x\\) and a function \\(f\\), we know that applying \\(f\\) on \\(x\\), i.e., \\(f(x)\\) does not change the value of \\(x\\), or any other unknowns \\(y\\), \\(z\\), etc.  We say that mathematical functions have no side effects.  It simply computes and returns the value.</p> <p>Why Side-Effect?</p> <p>The term side-effect should be compared with the main-effect (or primary effect) of a function.  Mathematically, a function is a transformation from one value to another value.  So the main-effect is to return that value without modifying any of the input.  Anything else is a side-effect.  Side-effect includes:</p> <ul> <li>Printing to the screen or other I/O write operation.</li> <li>Modify the value of a field.</li> <li>Mutating the input arguments.</li> <li>Invoking other functions with side-effects.</li> <li>Throwing exceptions.</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul> <p>Also note that observable behavior caused by the time taken for an operation to execute are ignored.</p> <p>Another property of mathematical function is referential transparency.  Let \\(f(x) = a\\).  Then in every formula that \\(f(x)\\) appears in, we can safely replace occurences of \\(f(x)\\) with \\(a\\).  Conversely, everywhere \\(a\\) appears, we can replace it with \\(f(x)\\).  We can be guarantee that the resulting formulas are still equivalent.</p> <p>Note that absence of side-effect does not guarantee referential transparency.  The function that returns the current time has no side-effect (i.e., it does not change the time, does not print on the screen, etc) but it is still not referentially transparent.  Invoking the same function at two different time produces different values.  To be referentially transparent, a function must also be deterministic.</p> <p>These two fundamental properties of mathematical functions allow us to solve equations, prove theorems, and reason about mathematical objects rigorously.  We call functions that are both side-effect free and referentially transparent as pure functions.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we can't always reason about our program the same way as we reason about mathematical functions.  For instance, consider the line:</p> <pre><code>a.get(0)\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>a</code> is an instance of <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code>.  Suppose we know that <code>a.get(0)</code> is 5 for some <code>a</code>.  When we reason about the behavior of our code, we cannot replace (mentally) every invocation of <code>a.get(0)</code> with the value 5.  This is because the array <code>a</code> may not be immutable and therefore <code>a.get(0)</code> cannot be guaranteed to be the same.</p> Can <code>a.get(0)</code> be Replaced with 5?No! <pre><code>a.get(0); // 5\n  :\na.get(0); // is it 5?\n</code></pre> <pre><code>a.get(0); // 5\na.set(0, 10);\na.get(0); // is it 5? NO, it's 10!\n</code></pre> <p>The reverse should be true as well.  Suppose we have a variable</p> <pre><code>T t = a.get(0);\n</code></pre> <p>Then everywhere in our code where we use <code>t</code>, we should be able to replace it with <code>a.get(0)</code>, and the behavior of the code should still be the same. This behavior is only guaranteed if <code>a.get(0)</code> has no side effects (such as modifying a field or print something to the standard output).</p> <p>Since our <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> code is written rather well, we will illustrate it with the following example.</p> <pre><code>class Counter {\n  private int count;\n  private int value;\n\n  public Counter(int value) {\n    this.value = value;\n  }\n\n  public int getValue() {\n    this.count++;\n    return this.value;\n  }\n\n  public int getCount() {\n    return this.count;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now suppose we have the following variable.</p> <pre><code>Counter ctx = new Counter(10);\nint val = ctx.getValue();\n</code></pre> <p>The question now is can we replace <code>val</code> with <code>ctx.getValue()</code> everywhere?  See the effect below.</p> Using <code>val</code>Using <code>ctx.getValue()</code> <pre><code>Counter ctx = new Counter(10);\nint val = ctx.getValue();\nint tmp1 = val;\nint tmp2 = val;\nint tmp3 = val;\nint end = tmp1 + tmp2 + tmp3 + ctx.getCount(); // 31\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Counter ctx = new Counter(10);\nint val = ctx.getValue();\nint tmp1 = ctx.getValue();\nint tmp2 = ctx.getValue();\nint tmp3 = ctx.getValue();\nint end = tmp1 + tmp2 + tmp3 + ctx.getCount(); // 34\n</code></pre> <p>To be able to reason about our code using the mathematical reasoning techniques we are familiar with, it is important to write our code as if we are writing mathematical functions -- our methods should be free of side effects and our code should be referentially transparent.  Our program is then just a sequence of functions, chained and composed together.

The latter is needed to write one sorting method for every possible sorting order for a list of strings, (<code>sortAlphabeticallyIncreasing</code>, <code>sortByLengthDecreasing</code>, etc..)</p> <p>The comparison function here is implemented as a method in an anonymous class that implements an interface.

The rewriting of the code above using anonymous class will be the following:</p> <pre><code>class A {\n  private int x;\n\n  public A(int x) {\n    this.x = x;\n  }\n\n  public int getX() {\n    Transformer&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; f = new Transformer&lt;&gt;() {\n      @Override\n      public Integer transform(Integer y) {\n        return this.x;\n      }\n    };\n    return f.transform(0);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Unfortunately this code does not compile.  In fact, we will get the following error</p> <pre><code>_.java:_: error: cannot find symbol\n        return this.x;\n                   ^\n  symbol: variable x\n1 error\n</code></pre> <p>The problem here is that the keyword <code>this</code> is referring to two different instances.  In the case of lambda, it is referring to the instance of class <code>A</code>.  On the other hand, in the case of anonymous class, <code>this</code> is referring to the instance of the anonymous class.  So it causes the error because the anonymous class has no field called <code>x</code>.</p> <p>However, in a way, it is reasonable when using lambda not to think about the presence of the anonymous class.  This is what we meant by lexical <code>this</code>.  So now we are faced with a slight conundrum because the mental model of having lambda as a syntactic sugar of anonymous class is useful but unfortunately wrong.</p> <p>Due to its usefulness, we will keep using the mental model of lambda being a syntactic sugar for anonymous class when tracing using stack and heap diagram.  However, the keyword <code>this</code> should be referring to the correct instance as per lexical <code>this</code>.</p>"},{"location":"30-functions.html#curried-functions","title":"Curried Functions","text":"<p>Mathematically, a function takes in only one value and returns one value (e.g., <code>square</code> above).  In programming, we often need to write functions that take in more than one argument (e.g., <code>add</code> above). Even though <code>Transformer</code> only supports function with a single parameter, we can build functions that take in multiple arguments.  Let's look at this mathematically first.  Consider a binary function \\(f: (X, Y) \\rightarrow Z\\).  We can introduce \\(F\\) as a set of all functions \\(f': Y \\rightarrow Z\\), and rewrite \\(f\\) as \\(f: X \\rightarrow F\\), or \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\).</p> <p>The arrow \\(\\rightarrow\\) is to be read from right-to-left.  So \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\) is equivalent to \\(f: X \\rightarrow (Y \\rightarrow Z)\\).  But what does it actually mean?  It means that instead of having a function that takes in two arguments, we can instead have a function that takes in one argument (typically the first argument) and return another function to accept the second argument.</p> <p>A trivial example of this is the <code>add</code> method that adds two <code>int</code> values. <pre><code>int add(int x, int y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>This can be written as <pre><code>Transformer&lt;Integer, Transformer&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;&gt; add = x -&gt; y -&gt; (x + y);\n</code></pre></p> <p>The way we read <code>x -&gt; y -&gt; (x + y)</code> is actually from right-to-left.  So, it is equivalent to <code>x -&gt; (y -&gt; (x + y))</code>.  We can then reason about this from innermost to outermost:</p> <ul> <li>Innermost: <code>y -&gt; (x + y)</code> is a function that takes in a single argument <code>y</code> and returns the sum of <code>(x + y)</code>.  Let us call this function <code>f_inner</code>.</li> <li>Outermost: <code>x -&gt; f_inner</code> is a function that takes in a single argument <code>x</code> and returns the innermost function <code>f_inner</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Combining the two, we can read it as follows:</p> <p><code>x -&gt; y -&gt; (x + y)</code> is a function that takes in a single argument <code>x</code> and returns another function.  The returned function takes in a single argument <code>y</code> and returns the result of adding <code>x</code> (the argument accepted by the outer function) with <code>y</code> (the argument accepted by the inner function).</p> <p>To calculate 1 + 1, we call <pre><code>add.transform(1).transform(1);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Let's break it down again, <code>add</code> is a function that takes in an <code>Integer</code> object and returns a unary <code>Function</code> over <code>Integer</code>.  So <code>add.transform(1)</code> returns the function <code>y -&gt; 1 + y</code>.  We could assign this to a variable: <pre><code>Transformer&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; incr = add.transform(1);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that <code>add</code> is no longer a function that takes two arguments and returns a value.  It is a higher-order function that takes in a single argument and returns another function.</p> <p>The technique that translates a general \\(n\\)-ary function to a sequence of \\(n\\) unary functions is called currying.  After currying, we have a sequence of curried functions.  </p> <p>Curry</p> <p>Currying is not related to food but rather is named after computer scientist Haskell Curry, who popularized the technique.</p> <p>How is currying useful?  Consider <code>add(1, 1)</code> -- we have to have both arguments available at the same time to compute the function.  With currying, we no longer have to.  We can evaluate the different arguments at a different time (as <code>incr</code> example above).  This feature is useful in cases where some arguments are not available until later.  We can partially apply a function first.  This is also useful if one of the arguments does not change often, or is expensive to compute.  We can save the partial results as a function and continue applying later.  We can dynamically create functions as needed, save them, and invoke them later.</p> <p>Instance Method as Partially Applied Class Method</p> <p>One popular point of view is that an instance method is a partially applied static method with an additional first parameter called <code>this</code>.  Take for instance an instance method <code>C::f(A1, A2)</code> in class <code>C</code> that takes in two parameters of type <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>.  This can also be viewed as a class method (i.e., with <code>static</code> keyword) of the form <code>C::f(C, A1, A2)</code>.  So instead of taking in two parameters, it takes in three parameters.  We assume that the first parameter <code>C</code> is called <code>this</code>.</p> <p>Of course, this view is just an approximation but it is a useful one.</p>"},{"location":"30-functions.html#lambda-as-closure","title":"Lambda as Closure","text":"<p>In the example, we showed earlier,</p> <pre><code>Point origin = new Point(0, 0);\nTransformer&lt;Point, Double&gt; dist = p -&gt; origin.distanceTo(p);\n</code></pre> <p>the variable <code>origin</code> is captured by the lambda expression <code>dist</code>.

Let's rename it to <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code>.  <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> is an option type, a common abstraction in programming languages (<code>java.util.Optional</code> in Java, <code>option</code> in Scala, <code>Maybe</code> in Haskell, <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> in C#, etc) that is a wrapper around a value that is either there or is <code>null</code>.  The <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> abstraction allows us to write code without mostly not worrying about the possibility that our value is missing.  When we call <code>map</code> on a value that is missing, nothing happens.</p> <p>Recall that we wish to write a program that is as close to pure mathematical functions as possible, a mathematical function always has a well-defined domain and codomain.</p> <p>Recap that in Lab 3, we had the following code in <code>Network.java</code>:</p> <pre><code>Agent agent = this.queue.poll();     // type added for clarity\nAgent next = agent.act(this.buffer); // type added for clarity\n\nSystem.out.println(agent);\n\nif (next != null) {\n  this.queue.add(next);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This comes from the fact that our method <code>Agent::act</code> may return a <code>null</code> value.  In other words, <code>act</code> is no longer a mapping from <code>Buffer</code> to <code>Agent</code> as in this case, there is a possibility that it returns a <code>null</code> which we do not consider to be an <code>Agent</code>.  Part of the reason why <code>null</code> is not an <code>Agent</code> is that we cannot perform an <code>act</code> on a <code>null</code> value.  This is also why we do not insert <code>null</code> into the queue.</p> <p>This violation of the puriting of the function adds complication to our code.  We have to add the check for <code>null</code> value.  One way to fix this is to for <code>Agent::act</code> to be a mapping from <code>Buffer</code> to <code>Maybe&lt;Agent&gt;</code>.  In such cases, we will no longer return a <code>null</code> value but we may actually return an instance of run-time type <code>None&lt;Agent&gt;</code> (the compile-time type will always be <code>Maybe&lt;Agent&gt;</code>).  If we make such changes, we can replace the code above with:</p> <pre><code>Agent agent = this.queue.poll();\nMaybe&lt;Agent&gt; next = agent.act(this.buffer);\n\nSystem.out.println(agent);\n\nnext.ifPresent(nxt -&gt; this.queue.add(nxt));\n</code></pre> <p>With this design, <code>Agent::act</code> is now a function with the domain <code>Buffer</code> mapped to the codomain <code>Maybe&lt;Agent&gt;</code>, and it is pure.</p> <p>Another way to view the <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> class is that it internalizes all the checks for <code>null</code> on the client's behalf.  <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> ensures that if <code>null</code> represents a missing value, then the semantics of this missing value is preserved throughout the chain of <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> operations.  Within its implementation, <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> do the right thing when the value is missing to prevent us from encountering <code>NullPointerException</code>.  There is a check for <code>null</code> when needed, internally, within <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code>.

Since the computation is asynchronous and could run in a different thread, the question of which thread should catch and handle the exception arises.  <code>CompletableFuture&lt;T&gt;</code> keeps things simpler by storing the exception and passing it down the chain of calls, until <code>join()</code> is called.  <code>join()</code> might throw <code>CompletionException</code> and whoever calls <code>join()</code> will be responsible for handling this exception.  The <code>CompletionException</code> contains information on the original exception.</p> <p>For instance, the code below would throw a <code>CompletionException</code> with a <code>NullPointerException</code> contains within it.</p> <pre><code>CompletableFuture.&lt;Integer&gt;supplyAsync(() -&gt; null)\n                 .thenApply(x -&gt; x + 1)\n                 .join();\n</code></pre> <p>Suppose we want to continue chaining our tasks despite exceptions.

The general idea for the fork-join model is to solve a problem by breaking up the problem into identical problems but with smaller size (fork), then solve the smaller version of the problem recursively, then combine the results (join).   This repeats recursively until the problem size is small enough -- we have reached the base case and so we just solve the problem sequentially without further parallelization.</p> <p>In Java, we can create a task that we can fork and join as an instance of abstract class <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code>.  <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code> supports the methods <code>fork()</code>, which submits a smaller version of the task for execution, and <code>join()</code> (which waits for the smaller tasks to complete and return).   <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code> has an abstract method <code>compute()</code>, which we, as the client, have to define to specify what computation we want to compute.</p> <p>Here is a simple <code>RecursiveTask&lt;T&gt;</code> that recursively sums up the content of an array: <pre><code>class Summer extends RecursiveTask&lt;Integer&gt; {\n  private static final int FORK_THRESHOLD = 2;\n  private int low;\n  private int high;\n  private int[] array;\n\n  public Summer(int low, int high, int[] array) {\n    this.low = low;\n    this.high = high;\n    this.array = array;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected Integer compute() {\n    // stop splitting into subtask if array is already small.\n    if (high - low &lt; FORK_THRESHOLD) {\n      int sum = 0;\n      for (int i = low; i &lt; high; i++) {\n        sum += array[i];\n      }\n      return sum;\n    }\n\n    int middle = (low + high) / 2;\n    Summer left = new Summer(low, middle, array);\n    Summer right = new Summer(middle, high, array);\n    left.fork();\n    return right.compute() + left.join();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>To run this task, we run: <pre><code>Summer task = new Summer(0, array.length, array);\nint sum = task.compute();\n</code></pre></p> <p>The line <code>task.compute()</code> above is just like another method invocation.

We then call <code>left.fork()</code>, which adds the tasks to a thread pool so that one of the threads can call its <code>compute()</code> method.  We subsequently call <code>right.compute()</code> (which is a normal method call).  Finally, we call <code>left.join()</code>, which blocks until the computation of the recursive sum is completed and returned.  We add the result from <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> together and return the sum.</p> <p>There are other ways we can combine and order the execution of <code>fork()</code>, <code>compute()</code>, and <code>join()</code>.

The details are beyond the scope of this module, but it would be interesting to note a few key points, as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Each thread has a deque<sup>1</sup> of tasks.  </li> <li>When a thread is idle, it checks its deque of tasks.  If the deque is not empty, it picks up a task at the head of the deque to execute (e.g., invoke its <code>compute()</code> method).  Otherwise, if the deque is empty, it picks up a task from the tail of the deque of another thread to run.  The latter is a mechanism called work stealing.</li> <li>When <code>fork()</code> is called, the caller adds itself to the head of the deque of the executing thread.  The method returns immediately and exeuction continues.  This may cause another <code>fork()</code> to be executed which adds another task into the head of the deque.  This is done so that the most recently forked task gets executed next, similar to how normal recursive calls.</li> <li>When <code>join()</code> is called, several cases might happen.  If the subtask to be joined hasn't been executed, its <code>compute()</code> method is called and the subtask is executed.  If the subtask to be joined has been completed (some other thread has stolen this and completed it), then the result is read, and <code>join()</code> returns.  If the subtask to be joined has been stolen and is being executed by another thread, then the current thread finds some other tasks to work on either in its local deque or steal another task from another deque.</li> </ul> <p>The beauty of the mechanism here is that the threads always look for something to do and they cooperate to get as much work done as possible.</p> <p>Note that task stealing is always done from the back.  In other words, an idle worker thread is always stealing a task from the tail of the deque of another worker thread.  This is because the order tasks are added is from the head of the deque.  So, tasks at the back is expected to have more unfinished computation compared to the tasks at the front of the deque.  This will then minimizes the number of task stealing needed<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>The mechanism here is similar to that implemented in .NET and Rust.</p>"},{"location":"40-forkjoin.html#order-of-fork-and-join","title":"Order of <code>fork()</code> and <code>join()</code>","text":"<p>One implication of how <code>ForkJoinPool</code> adds and removes tasks from the deque is the order in which we call <code>fork()</code> and <code>join()</code>.  Since the most recently forked task is likely to be executed next, we should <code>join()</code> the most recent <code>fork()</code> task first.  In other words, the order of forking should be the reverse of the order of joining.</p> <p>In the class <code>Summer</code> above, <pre><code>left.fork();  // &gt;-----------+\nright.fork(); // &gt;--------+  | should have\nreturn right.join() // &lt;--+  | no crossing\n     + left.join(); // &lt;-----+\n</code></pre></p> <p>is more efficient than <pre><code>left.fork();  // &gt;-------------+\nright.fork(); // &gt;----------+  | there is crossing\nreturn left.join()   // &lt;---|--+\n      + right.join(); // &lt;---+\n</code></pre></p> <p>In other words, your <code>fork()</code>, <code>compute()</code>, <code>join()</code> order should form a palindrome and there should be no crossing.  Additionally, there should only be at most a single <code>compute</code> and it should be in the middle of the palindrome.</p> <p>For example, the following is ok. <pre><code>left.fork();  // &gt;-----------+\nreturn right.compute() //    | compute in middle\n     + left.join(); // &lt;-----+\n</code></pre></p> <p>But the following is not. <pre><code>return left.compute()    // this is practically\n     + right.compute(); // not even concurrent\n</code></pre></p> <p>There are a combination of reason for this efficiency.  Firstly, the operation on the deque has to be atomic.  In other words, when a thread \\(T_1\\) is operating on its deque \\(D_1\\), the thread \\(T_1\\) has to finish its operation before another thread \\(T_2\\) can operate on \\(D_1\\) (e.g., task stealing, etc).  Atomic operations are expensive by default so the more operation is being performed, the slower the program will be.</p> <p>This is coupled by the behavior of <code>join()</code> that when called, find and executes the subtask if it is not yet computed.  If this subtask is not at the front of the deque, then we require a search which is a combination of pop and push on a deque as opposed to just a single pop if the task is at the head of the deque.</p> <ol> <li> <p>A deque is a double-ended queue.

There is also <code>java.lang</code> where we import the <code>Math</code> class from.  These are provided by Java as standard libraries.  We can also create our package and put the classes and interfaces into the same package. We (and the clients) can then import and use the classes and interfaces that we provide.</p> <p>Java package provides a higher-layer of abstraction barrier. We can designate a class to be used outside a package by prefixing the keyword <code>class</code> with the access modifier <code>public</code>.  We can further fine-tune which fields and methods are accessible from other classes in the same package using the <code>protected</code> access modifier.</p> <p>You can read more about java packages and the <code>protected</code> modifier yourself through Oracle's Java tutorial.</p> <p>As a summary, the access levels are as follows.</p> Modifier Access from same class Access from same package(or the same directory) Access from subclass(other directory) Access from other class(other directory) <code>public</code> <code>protected</code> <code>private</code> <p>The table above is also the reason why we do not allow <code>protected</code> keyword in earlier labs.

These commands are like a programming language.  It is also not unlike the Unix commands, in that each command does a small thing but can be composed together to perform complex text manipulation.</p> <p>Let me give an example here.  Suppose you have a sentence:</p> <pre><code>Wherever there is light, there is also a shadow.\n</code></pre> <p>You want to remove <code>also a</code> from the sentence.</p> <p>What would you do in a typical text editor?  You can use move your hand away from the keyboard, find your mouse, move your mouse cursor to highlight the text, and then hit Del.  Or you could move the cursor (by mouse or by repeatedly hitting the keyboard) to place the cursor after <code>a</code>, and then press Del six times.</p> <p>In addition to being tedious, this is error-prone.  You might highlight one additional or one less space, or hit Del one too many times.</p> <p>What we are used to doing is performing the action of deleting the words ourselves.  For <code>vim</code>, we do it differently.  We need to look for the word <code>also</code> and delete two words.  This translates to the command / A L S O Enter D 2 W.</p> <ul> <li>/ triggers a search.  This is an almost universal command -- try / on Facebook (web) or on this page.</li> <li>A L S O Enter tells <code>vim</code> what you want to search. After pressing Enter, your cursor should be placed at the beginning of <code>also</code>.</li> <li>D 2 W tell <code>vim</code> to \"delete two words\".</li> </ul> <p>Instead of worrying about the actual actions to perform the deletion, we issue higher-level commands to describe what we want to do.  This is powerful since this is how our brain thinks -- \"I need to insert this here, change this word to that, remove two lines, etc.\"  All these maps into commands in <code>vim</code>.  As a result, once you master <code>vim</code> basics, you can type as fast as you think<sup>1</sup>!</p> <p>A common pattern for <code>vim</code> command consists of three parts:</p> <ol> <li>Place the cursor.</li> <li>Perform an action.</li> <li>Move to the new placement of the cursor.</li> </ol> <p>In the example above, / A L S O Enter places the cursor, D is the action (delete), and 2 W is the movement (move the cursor forward by two words).</p> <p>Another common command that students used is G G = Shift+G.
